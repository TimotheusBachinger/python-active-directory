#
# Some test in the FreeADI test suite require an Active Directory. These tests
# are disabled by default and can be enabled below. A great way of doing AD
# tests is to install an AD forest in one or multiple virtual machines on the
# current system, and connect the systems to a virtual network that is shared
# with the host. Be sure to enable DNS services in the forest. Then add a line
# to "/etc/resolv.conf" pointing to a DNS server in the new AD forest.  This is
# sufficient to start using AD tests.

# Set to 1 to enable tests that require read access to an active directory. All
# tests that become enabled by this setting are non-intrusive.

# Change to the domain that is to be used for AD tests.

#                   WARNING !!! WARNING !!! WARNING !!!
#
# FreeADI has support for "intrusive tests". These tests require elevated
# privileges on the current system or in the directory, and may change
# system configurations and update or delete data.
#
# All intrusive tests are disabled by default. They can be enabled by
# settings the following variables to "1" and providing the proper password
# in this configuration file.
#
#  - root_tests:           Controls tests that require root access.
#  - firewall_tests:       Controls tests that change the firewall configuration of
#  		           the local system to test certain aspects (mostly
#  		           error conditions) of protocol clients implemented by
#  		           FreeADI.
#  - admin_tests:  	   Controls tests that require AD administrator access.
#  - ad_write_tests:  	   Enables tests that access or modify data in Active
#                          Directory. Depending on the setting of administrator_tests
#                          is disabled, these tests will or will not modify data.
#
# Intrusive tests should be in an environment that is not production critical.
# A good candidate for such an environment would be a set of virtualised host
# running on a developer workstations which are connected to a host-only
# network. See the section above on AD tests on how to set up such an
# environment.
#
# Intrusive tests are written such that after running a set of tests the system
# will be in a state that allows running the tests again, and so on.  In
# particular no restore from backup (or restore to snapshot in a virtual
# environment) is required after running the tests. It is not guaranteed
# however that after a running a set of tests the system will be in the same
# state as it was before the tests. This is the reason that intrusive tests
# should never be run on a production environment.

# Set to 1 to enable tests that require local admin (root) access, 0 to
# disable.
